# 100 Days of Machine Learning

Welcome to my 100 Days of Machine Learning challenge! This repository documents my journey as I commit to learning and practicing machine learning concepts and techniques over the next 100 days.

## About

Machine learning is a rapidly evolving field with vast applications across various industries. Through this challenge, I aim to deepen my understanding of machine learning algorithms, tools, and applications, and to develop practical skills through hands-on projects.

## Goals

- Gain proficiency in machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks.
- Learn how to preprocess data, handle missing values, and perform feature engineering.
- Explore different evaluation metrics and techniques for model evaluation and selection.
- Apply machine learning algorithms to real-world datasets and projects.
- Share my progress, insights, and projects with the community to foster learning and collaboration.

## Resources

Throughout this challenge, I'll be leveraging various resources to aid my learning journey, including:

- Online courses: Coursera, Udemy, and Khan Academy offer comprehensive courses on machine learning.
- Online platforms: Kaggle, Towards Data Science, and Medium provide datasets, tutorials, and articles on machine learning.
- Open-source libraries: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch are popular libraries for implementing machine learning algorithms.
