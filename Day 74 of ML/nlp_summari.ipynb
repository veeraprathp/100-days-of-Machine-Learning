In the 19th century, the German states began to unify, culminating in the formation of the German Empire in 1871 under the leadership of Prussia. Germany rapidly industrialized and became a major world power.\n",

In 1990, following the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Soviet Union, Germany was reunified as a single country.\n",
